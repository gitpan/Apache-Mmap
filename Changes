	- Moved everything from under plain RCS to CVS for better 
	  release management.
	- Upgraded my copy of perl 5.004_04.
	- Fixed typo in eg/bench.pl (forgot a ',').
	- Fixed typo in eg/bench2.pl and made it take # of test from
	  command line.
	- Added code to make Apache::Mmap::TIEHANDLE call the 
	  Apache::Mmap::Handler::TIEHANDLE sub.  Had to hardcode
	  the class in Apache::Mmap::Handler::TIEHANDLE to 
	  'Apache::Mmap::Handler' rather than use what gets passed
	  in by tie.
	- Added eg/MmapHandler.pm example PerlHandler.  
	- Added warning about mapping offsets on page boundaries on
	  some platforms (Solaris at least) thanks to mail from Evan
 	  Champion.
