Apache::Mmap Version 0.04
-------------------------

Updated: 08/29/97

This is a Perl5 extension interface to the mmap(2) system call.  A
file can be mapped into memory and then read from (or written to)
via a scalar.  More complete documentation is in Mmap.pm (You can
read it with 'perldoc Mmap.pm').
 
To build the extension, unpack this distribution, create the Makefile
using 'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make'.  As this is alpha software,
you should probably also do a 'make test' before trying to 'make
install'.  A message about not being able to bootstrap Apache::Constants
outside httpd is normal.

The module was developed with perl 5.004_01, and the example
Apache::Mmap::handler was tested with:

Server version Apache/1.2.1 mod_perl/1.00.

The "t" directory contains two test scripts: 'tie.t' which tests just
the XSUB TIESCALAR methods, and 'mmap.t' which checks the mmap/munmap
methods.  The "eg" directory contains two sample benchmark scripts:
'bench.pl' which uses LWP::UserAgent to retrieve files from a
mod_perl'd apache, and 'bench2.pl' which compares reading from a
mapped scalar vs. reading a file with open|while(<FILE>).

A prelimiary version of a package implementing the TIEHANDLE methods
using a mmap'd file (Apache::Mmap::Handle) is also included.  It's
currently written entirely in perl and does a lot of copying of data
around memory.  On my Linux box it's about an order of magnitude
slower than using the tied scalar.  It currently works read-only
(e.g. you can't tie a handle for writing).

The module is known to work (or seems to work :) on at least:

* Linux 2.0.30 
* Solaris 2.5.1

It should work on other UNIXish platforms which support the mmap(2)
system call.  If you get it to work on another version, please let
me know.

Please send any bug reports, queries, large wads of unmarked bills,
etc. to the author.  The latest version should be available from
my web page URL<http://www.mindspring.com/~lemur1/> or from a CPAN
mirror near you.
